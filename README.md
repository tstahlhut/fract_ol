# fract_ol
42 project: First graphical project of the core curriculum of 42 school

## Description

Fract_ol is one of the first graphical projects a 42 student may choose. The aim is to display fractals, the Mandelbrot set and the Julia set with the help of a graphical school library (MiniLibX) which has been internally developed. MiniLibX only includes basic tools, as opening a window, creating images and dealing with keyboard and mouse events.

From the manual of MiniLibX:
  "MiniLibX is an easy way to create graphical software, without any X-Window programming knowledge.
    It provides simple window creation, a drawing tool, image and basic events management."

During this project one learns about complex numbers, the concept of optimization in computer graphics and event handling. 

### Allowed Functions

Besides MiniLibX, all functions of the math library are allowed, as well as the following functions:
- open, close
- read, write
- malloc, free
- perror, strerror
- exit

All other functions have to be written by the students themselves.

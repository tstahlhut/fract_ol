# fract_ol
42 project: First graphical project of the core curriculum of 42 school

## Description

Fract_ol is one of the first graphical projects a 42 student may choose. The aim is to display fractals, the Mandelbrot set and the Julia set with the help of a graphical school library (MiniLibX) which has been internally developed. MiniLibX only includes basic tools, as opening a window, creating images and dealing with keyboard and mouse events.

From the manual of MiniLibX:
  "MiniLibX is an easy way to create graphical software, without any X-Window programming knowledge.
    It provides simple window creation, a drawing tool, image and basic events management."

During this project one learns about complex numbers, the concept of optimization in computer graphics and event handling. 

### Allowed Functions

Besides MiniLibX, all functions of the math library are allowed, as well as the following functions:
- open, close
- read, write
- malloc, free
- perror, strerror
- exit

All other functions have to be written by the students themselves.

## What is a fractal?

The term fractal was coined by mathematican Beno√Æt Mandelbrot in 1975 and is derived from the latin word fractus. 
Fractals are geometric patterns or forms 

The most common fractals are defined in the two- and three-dimensional Euclidean space and include for example the Mandelbrot and Julia set. Both of which are defined in the complex plane.

### Mandelbrot Set

The Mandelbrot set is a two-dimensional set defined in the complex plane as the complex number c:
    which the function $f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c$
    $ z n + 1 = z n 2 + c {\displaystyle z_{n+1}=z_{n}^{2}+c}
